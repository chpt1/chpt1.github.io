										<b>
											Thank you so much for taking the time to interview with Chapter1! Let’s begin.
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
											How did you initially get involved with programming and product design?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										I think it is key to understand my background before I was even able to write my first line of code and type in my first line of Comic Sans styled text in GIMP. 
										<br /><br/>
										My parents were staunchly against videogames, I remember being around 5 or 6 years old and seeing and hearing about commercials about the PlayStation and hear about my friends that were playing them. I remember asking my parents to get one and it would always be a firm no. The only exposure to any sort of computer entertainment I had around that time was the Reader Rabbit games that I would play on my kindergarten’s Apple IIGS. It was around this time my family got this terrible HP computer running Windows ME loaded with all this bloatware and chugged along with 258 MB of RAM and a Celeron Class Intel processor. Whenever my parents aren’t home, I was the worst user- I installed freeware screensavers, Bonzi buddy, uncountable amounts of cursors. In other words, I installed many types of shareware it wasn’t funny. But what quickly happened is that I was able to develop this aptitude to fix many of the problems I caused on the family computer at a very young age.
										<br /><br/>
										Apparently in school, this aptitude was spotted by the school’s local IT technician Paul Buscher. And while my participation in computing wasn’t encouraged at home, I had support from him. If it wasn’t for this chance encounter, I don’t think I would have continued to get into trouble on the PC. A while later- I was able to get involved into these games called Toontown and Neopets and started messing around with the in game files, started learning an extremely abstracted level how game engines work- got involved with a Fan forum called Toon task and overtime I just started to make fan graphics in GIMP and had a desire to work on projects. Neopets introduced me to HTML. But my young mind just couldn’t grasp programming on my own. So I went to a library got a book on programming Visual Basic and subsequently gave up because all the current IDE tools didn’t support Windows ME by then. So for a while I would meander around tech as far as gaming and design is concerned. 
										<br /><br/>
										As I grew up, the forum brought my attention to more mature games like Call of Duty 2 and EVE but I wasn’t able to run them. So I had a desire to build by own computer, at this point and time the HP was retired because my parents wanted to run Office 2003 but the specs weren’t up to snuff. At the time I was running a single core Athlon x64 and an integrated nVidia 6150 so I got involved in F2P shooters and alternative servers. Started getting involved with those communities and realized I needed to build my own computer. But when your parents didn’t really see the value of buying computer parts I started jailbreaking my friends iPod’s for money and repairing my teacher’s computers. I eventually got a generous donation from the now defunct TigerDirect through ComputerTV. Later I started doing web design and branding for a short lived tech website and started getting involved doing graphic and video design on various video gaming forums.  It wasn’t until high school when my AP History teacher asked for a website to be done in exchange for money I actually got serious about development and design. At that time, I started asking meaningful questions about their desired web-presence, made in depth mockups in Photoshop. Did multiple tutorials from PSDTuts and WebDesignTuts. And sure I was able to get Creative Cloud through less than legal ways, I was fortunate enough where in my high school I was able to snap a school install of the Creative Suite 4 master collection. And even though I was doing cross country and school work I did my best to make sure my customers were as happy as possible even though I was mostly unqualified for those jobs. I wouldn’t say I was the perfect freelance developer but it was good enough to get my start in the field.  Around this time I revisited learning how to code seriously but was so intimidated by the field I ended up switching my desire to be a developer into becoming a EE major. It also helped that my parents respected the engineering appended to my major title. After a few impactful personal setbacks, I ended up going to Florida International University. Accidentally joined my first startup and started going to hackathons with the most talented group of developers I knew at that time and eventually got serious about development. My freshman year I went to around 7 hackathons during my Spring and Summer semesters. Just being around that environment allowed me to focus on the oft asked questions in development and more so for product design.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										Describe your role as a platform engineering intern at Adobe? What is a platform engineer as opposed to a software engineer? What did you work on?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										Adobe has around 5 general types of engineers as far as I know of, and it mostly depends on the team that you are working on. You have your front-end engineers who help create and implement the front-end interfaces on multiple products. We have Computer Scientist Interns, where they tend to be in the middle of the stack that also includes folks who ended up working on security patches. Your data folks, who are working on analytics data or input from Marketing cloud (more on that later). We even had PhD students coming in and doing research with us. Lastly you had people on our infrastructure team called our Cloud Platform Engineering team. 
										<br /><br/>
										Platform Engineering for us are folks working on software or solutions that we would develop in-house or implement to make it so that the hundreds of software products and services that we would deploy either internally or externally were able to be shipped across the software release cycle. Developer Operations if you would. Your average software engineer would work on specific features for specific products where the platform team would work on features for internal products to make it so we can ship features. 
										<br /><br/>
										The team I was placed in was a platform team was initially from one of Adobe’s acquired companies called Behance and over time, the Engineering leadership really became attracted to the idea of containerization and tight coupling between our codebases and our CI/CD pipeline. When Behance was acquired in 2013, this was right around the time Adobe made the decision to move from literal Boxed yearly releases known as Creative Suite to Creative Cloud. We needed to make sure our cloud infrastructure was up to snuff. Initally, Adobe got things wrong- downloads were slow, many of their online products weren’t intuitive. When you have such important software for content creation you want to make it so that all of the pieces of what you are (or aren’t paying for) are working all the time. So around the time the idea of unikernals spawned the idea of Docker and Mesos, that was really when infrastructure teams were able to be very clever with being able to allocate time and resources to making the software shipping process as pain free as possible. 
										<br /><br/>
										So that’s what my team did, we worked on software build tools that were used across the company. The work is important, and rewarding especially if we got developer experience aspects of it correctly. We wanted the build pipeline to have it so that we can push your feature from dev to test to staging to production as simple as possible. And if anything went wrong, we wanted to allow teams to recover as gracefully as possible. I was responsible for abstracting some of that functionality via API to get ready for the new versions of the tooling. Similar to what Automattic did with the older versions of Wordpress. Essentially wrapping older parts of our tooling around routes.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										What is a typical day at Adobe? What is the work culture like?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										For my internship I was based out of the Seattle office, so my experience was not indicative of Adobe’s headquarters. A typical day would require me on some days to hop on for standup at 8 AM. Our team has a very strong remote culture- team members were able to jump on standup from home until traffic cleared up enough for folks to come into the office. Once the tasks were reported to our PM I would spend the week working on features. My office wasn’t open floorplan which was great because it afforded me enough privacy to not feel like I was always being watched and allowed me to google my problems in confidence. 
										<br /><br/>
										For interns, lunch was free so that was always convenient. But in addition, the office was right on the Fremont Canal, it was a beautiful workplace and they allowed me an experience where I felt like I was able to become fully integrated into the team. I was given the same cards a Full-Time and I was shipping and breaking things into production. Our team was very close, people freely asked for help, but it was slightly strange that I had some team members all across the country so even though there were 4 of us in Seattle- we had 20 people within the team active on Slack.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										What were some challenges you encountered as an intern at Adobe?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										Not necessarily with Adobe in particular, but it was challenging as someone who was moving out of my parents house to go live on my own for 3 months. Being in a environment where you don't really know anyone really made me have to come out of my shell and start going to meetups. 
										<br /><br/>
										It also goes to mention, for any new internship the on-boarding period is like drinking out of a firehouse.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										People primarily know Adobe for their suite of software related to film/photo editing and viewing/editing PDFs. What else does Adobe work on?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										Adobe also offers a suite of rich tools for marketing and advertisers to help create and market campaigns of all types. This was formerly known as Marketing Cloud- but has been renamed to Experience Cloud. Experience Cloud is a suite that has around 10 different products that include rich online advertising analytic tools, campaign management, email campaigns and much more. It is a Swiss army toolkit for advertising teams. It is quite heavy a solution but is the go to for major firms and in-house PR teams in companies. In addition, we have a myriad of apps that help make editing easier that not many people know about, along with easy to use post generation. 
										<br /><br/>
										On top of the above flagship products, we also have TypeKit included with Creative Cloud subscriptions where you have access to some premium fonts from well-known foundries. Adobe has a rich Stock photo collection and product. Many users don’t know about the better Creative Cloud interop that they are supporting. Adobe also does software consulting in rare cases, we did some work with SAP HANA and making sure we built out some integrations for a client (which is very very rare) and we also run Behance and support quite a bit of student research. This is also not including any future projects and internal tooling which also are products within themselves.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										Would you say that this internship augmented your skills as a developer?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										I was very fortunate to get this internship. I didn’t have the confidence to apply to roles until December and Florida International University isn’t a top school considered by many tech companies. So upon receiving an offer, the first thing this internship really affirmed my imposter syndrome. But then it dawned on me, if I am an imposter that was a able to sneak on by- then that is a accomplishment in itself. I just so happen to be an imposter with good debugging skills and the ability to ship code. 
										<br /><br/>
										Once the internship started, there is this entire set of soft skills and coordination that isn’t able to be taught in school and hackathons and that is long term project commitment and execution. So I was able to become nimbler as requirements changed and as teammates encounter roadblocks. 
										<br /><br/>
										Considering I switched into my major a little late, my manager really helped me come into my own as a developer by really reinforcing the basics. Making sure I am following and documenting my code. Getting a sense of what a good and a bad implementation entails. One of the biggest problems going into this role as a developer is how raw I was in terms of skill. I had an idea of where I wanted to be but I didn’t know how to reach that next step and most of it was the soft skills. Sure knowing your data structures and being able to have a good grasp of OO is fine.   But the stuff that I learned that got me far was being able to work well with my co-workers, getting over my fear of asking for help and working on becoming a good professional. 
										<br /><br/>
										Even though I would honestly say I wasn’t a rock star by any means- my team reminded me that it is more important of being a good person to work with rather carrying 30 points of work on your back than being intolerable.
										<br /><br/>
										One last thing to mention is that there no substitute than breaking production. Rite of passage.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										Aside from your internship, you also hold an advisory role at Loomia. What do you do there and how did you get involved?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										One of my last ventures that is still ongoing but I am no longer involved with is Distributed ID, a startup that focused on handling ID verification on the Blockchain. It is now headed by Duncan Brown. For those that don’t know, “the” Blockchain is a data structure with a peer to peer protocol that allows records on a ledger to be made with a cryptographic hash confirming each transaction. The best part about it is that all the members who “buy into” the network perform work verifying each transaction. This is where the Distributed aspect comes into play and arguably the most exciting. In layman’s terms- people witness people’s transactions when you move tokens. I have been a follower of Bitcoin ever since my EVE days, but haven’t dived into the specifics of development for this technology until the Etherium Homestead release. Before I got into blockchain dev- I did two forays into the viability of meshnets with Cambio and Metroboom; two hackathon projects. 
										For the uninformed, Loomia is a start-up that makes smart textiles. These textiles enable smart products that may include blockchain technology. They have built jackets with heaters in it, touch sensitive fabrics, and optically infused fabrics. They aspire to connect consumers and companies in mutually beneficial and seamless exchange. Loomia is already advised by a highly experienced team of folks who have worked in the fashion industry but needed some help when it came to building their technical advisory board. To do so they looked to their 2nd degree network. Being that I have been involved with the Blockchain Education Network through two directors- having someone who had a moderate network and the ability to set up connections was key.
										<br /><br/>
										For many folks who do know 1517, the VC fund, Danielle and Michael knew me from my hackathon escapades but also knew that I did work on Blockchain projects from a while back. So when Loomia was announcing a token it appeared to be a good fit. After some due-diligence that was done on both sides… I currently advise the Loomia team on software architecture on where to implement product features that can use Blockchain most effectively. In addition, I am helping the team navigate some of the frustrations of due-diligence. Since I have witnessed the evolution of some frameworks and some products I also help build proof of concepts time permitting. 
										<br /><br/>
										For many companies nowadays there is a big shock that is somewhat coming out of the cryptocurrency world because there is so much uncertainty on what the future might look like with all these ICOs that have been happening. As someone who experienced tons of rhetoric about “revolutionary” technologies like Virtualization and The Cloud from times before, Blockchain will have the same buzzwords and its impact will be similar to the technologies mentioned before. They will build industries and build viable companies, but it won’t be this switch that changes the world. It will be important, yes, but at the risk of my career- the movement has a bunch of hot air. The same way now most tech companies now use some sort of public cloud. In the right use cases, Blockchain will have that use case. But decentralized Blockchain Uber isn’t the future. There are still many issues with scaling and viability something that I am working very closely with the team to accomplish. 
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										Even as a student who primarily focuses on grades and extracurricular activities, you seem to also take on even more additional responsibilities (such as holding an advisory role at Loomia). What is your reasoning for doing so? How do you manage your time in order to balance it all?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										Hahaha- I have been working on this thing called balance. It still has been very illusive.  One thing that comes up is passion, the stuff I do outside of school doesn’t feel like work. I am extremely discontent with my surroundings, but I have faith that I can be constructive about those feelings. So much of my volunteer work, like organizing MangoHacks, and advocacy comes out of a desire to improve my surroundings to namely improve the opportunities for the folks that live with me in the city of Miami. 
										<br /><br/>
										I do this because in order for me to get involved in tech- I had to struggle to find my place. I hope the next wave of people don’t have to go what I have gone through. Hopefully through the advocacy work, the wall of hazing and intimidation that it takes to make people belong in tech becomes mitigated. 
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										Any advice or suggestions for our non-technical readers who want to get involved with software engineering?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										No good professional has been good instantaneously, it has come through practice, experience and most of all, travel. Either physically or academically- there exists a starting point (or multiple) from where we once decided to take up anything. The reality is, people do take multiple tries to pick up the computer arts, people do give up on projects, it is hard to write bug free software and yes sometimes the process is mentally painful. But there has always been a point where people have been there. Or heaven’s sake, one of the most popular stack overflow answers is a response on how to quit the terminal editor Vim.
										<ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
											<li>Go to hackathons</li>
											<li>Make friends.</li>
											<li>Join technical Facebook groups.</li>
											<li>Write code.</li>
											<li>Trust the process.</li>
										</ul>
										Remember - you belong in tech.
