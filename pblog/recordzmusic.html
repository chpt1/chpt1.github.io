									<p><!-- the interview -->
										<b>
										During your freshmen year, how did you balance school life (academia, social life, clubs, etc) with RecordzMusic?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										During my first semester at Rutgers Business School, it was immensely tough to balance my school life. On top of academics and life in general, I needed to focus on the core aspects of a startup (developing, project management networking, marketing, business development, etc). I decided to suspend my education at Rutgers; I wanted to position the company to maximize the potential success.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										How do you plan to effectively market your web platform?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										The best way to market a product is by having a beautiful platform that solves a problem. Our platform, A) has such a gorgeous user interface & B) solves a problem by leveling out the playing field in the music industry; providing a brand new innovative opportunity through music. So we’re set on those two aspects! On the other hand, we’re taking several measures to directly market RecordzMusic. One that really helped already is engaging with our target market. By doing this, we were able to garner 65K subscribers to our email list that’s growing each day. We’re of course going to use this email list to our advantage by blasting emails to all of our subscribers about our launch & future developments. Additionally, we’re planning to use Facebook, Instagram & Google Ads. These ad networks will be uniquely designed to promote our product towards our audience. We’re taking advantage of social media boasting a following over 8K on Twitter with tons of engagement with each tweet that we send out. Our team will continue to directly engage with our target market and will visit recording studios to seek out great talent. Also, our team is very well connected in the music industry & all of our connections are excited to help with traction.
										<br /><br />
										<b>How do you distinguish your platform from your competitors? What will make people move away from subscription based music playing platforms such as Spotify and Apple music?</b> 
										<br /><br/>
										I love this question! RecordzMusic is NOT competing with Spotify, nor Apple Music. We’re a community of underground & independent creators. Our platform is specifically designed to encourage discovery and engagement. On existing platforms, artist discovery is limited, controlled by major labels and not designed to give independent artists a fair shot. We’re leveling the playing field in the music industry by allowing anyone with a shot of becoming discovered by unbiasing our algorithms. These new, unique algorithms will suggest artists and content in a way other platforms simply do not provide.We’re for artists and want to see artists on our platform succeed to their greatest potential. Therefore, we will directly manage & develop an artist with potential and vault them to mainstream success.Our connections, resources & technology becomes theirs. There's an oversaturation of mainstream music and people are ignoring great, raw, undiscovered talent. We’re for fostering the success of these artists. Artists & Listeners will have a new, dynamic relationship by being interconnected throughout our community. 
										<br /><br/>
										<b>Describe to us an example of your typical workday.</b>
										<br /><br/>
										To start, my sleeping schedule is chaotic to say the least. I usually don’t go to bed until 3:30AM & I wake up around 9AM. Right when I wake up, I go to my list of artists and directly engage with them by writing them an email expressing my interest in their music. I also include a description of RecordzMusic & they’re very interested from the start. I usually engage with this marketing technique for about 5-6 hours / day. I talk to each of my co founders (Thomas Cutting, CTO & Marcus Martinez, Lead of Product & Strategy) daily if we do not meet up. I also work on business development (financial models, marketing plans, branding aspects, etc). During my breaks, I love eating at my mothers take out restaurant (Princeton Soup & Sandwich), watching action & business movies, watching football & working out.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>What are some of your biggest challenges while working on RecordzMusic?</b>
										<br /><br/>
										Finding the right team was the biggest challenge -- a startup is not a one man show. Like a sports team, all players need to come together with one vision and plan to execute. Once you have a strong team, the potential of a startup feels limitless.. Thomas & Marcus are great teammates who are brilliant. Thomas is an absolute BEAST at web/app developing. Awesome guy, great communicator & pure genius. Marcus is the music genius in the group. He has his masters in Global Music Business from the elite Berklee College of Music. His industry knowledge and vision of the music industry makes him such a great asset. Together, we will be able to conquer our goals.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>You are launching RecordzMusic the beginning of March (3/1/17). That’s a really exciting time for you and your startup! What sort of immediate results are you expecting?</b>
										<br /><br/>
										We’re expecting a lot of activity and we’re preparing to grow quickly. Growing first starts with the product & RecordzMusic is such a bad-ass platform.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>What stage are you in your capital investing phase? Are you currently looking for more funding?</b>
										<br /><br/>
										We currently have an angel investor. We will be actively contacting our VC connections once we launch on March 1st to raise seed funding.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>How will RecordzMusic generate net revenue?</b>
										<br /><br/>
										Running lean is very important. Too many startups spend, spend, spend on unnecessary things.That being said, we have 4 different monetization plans Recordz Plus: $4.99/month (or $45.00/year) this includes unlimited uploads, See information about who is playing your music & where your music is being shared. Recordz Premium: $14.99/month (or $140.00/year) Includes all Plus features & access to weekly list of most likely new fans. Play Playlists Offline: $5.99 / month. An interesting business model is our Artist Management & Development aspect of RecordzMusic: We take X% of artist revenue depending on the artist that we decide to invest/manage in. Also, we invest in individual shows for artists. % of total revenue that we take changes on case to case basis (these shows will always be profitable).
										<br /><br/>
										<b>How do you see RecordzMusic being major key player in the music playing industry within the next 10 years?</b>
										<br /><br/>
										RecordzMusic will facilitate the success of so many talented artists. We will be like the college football league to the NFL. We have plans to expand our community and company to innovative divisions within Recordz allowing us to expand our market share. Artists will be able to stay independent & persevere. RecordzMusic will be viewed as a company that empowers creativity through one of the strongest forms of art, music. 
										<br /><br/>
										<b>Any advice for our future entrepreneurs?</b>
										<br /><br/>
										Entrepreneurship is a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Block out all the noise and prepare yourself mentality and just grind out the work. Anything is possible with the right mindset.. You have to be obsessed with succeeding. If it’s not an obsessive passion, it’ll be hard to succeed.
