										<b>
										What are Goblies? What is it made out of and how is it made?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										Goblies are washable paintballs that you throw by hand. They are painless like water balloons and create a colorful splatter like paintballs. The paintballs are made entirely from food ingredients. I started selling Goblies as a DIY kit that allows kids to make Goblies while learning about chemistry. The kit allows kids to make Goblies by dropping ice in a special syrup.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>
										How did you think of the idea for the product? What was the motivation behind it?
										</b>
										<br /><br/>
										The primary market for the Goblies kits are the parents of 8-12 years old that want their kids to engage with science in a fun way. 
										<br /><br/>
										The overall market for throwable paintballs are seekers of “Instagram worthy moments” People that are interested in Goblies want interesting life experiences. They want to make memories. I have an event based marketing strategy. 
										<br /><br/>
										<b>Your product, Goblies, is a product of your company, Mezzimatic LLC. Do plan on releasing other products in the near future? </b>
										<br /><br/>
										I started Goblies as a DIY Kit that allows kids to make Goblies at home. I plan on releasing a no-prep needed version in the spring of 2017 (Just pop open the container and throw). I plan on scaling the company through market development.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>Describe to us an example of your typical workday.</b>
										<br /><br/>
										I usually have 10-20 goals I’m trying to accomplish for the month. For example, working on a sale, increasing the manufacturing efficiency in a particular area, trying to decrease the cost of one area of the product, designing packaging, figuring out something with logistics, planning a booth for a trade show, etc. I’m either researching, talking to people, prototyping or making decisions in attempt to make those goals happen.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>What stage are you in your capital investing phase? Are you currently looking for more funding?</b>
										<br /><br/>
										I have funded the company through bootstrapping and I utilized a grant to purchase manufacturing equipment. I'm not actively seeking funding, but I'm open to opportunities.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>What are some challenges you encounter as the CEO of Mezzimatic LLC?</b>
										<br /><br/>
										Every time I’m asked about what the challenges are of running my company I gravitate towards the overall challenge of deciding on if I should take on investors and debt in effort to grow faster. This is something that I will be thinking about at every stage of my company.
										<br /><br/>
										<b>Any advice for our aspiring entrepreneurs?</b>
										<br /><br/>
										I’ve been writing business plans and researching ideas for years. The difference between those businesses and Goblies is that I was able to make a working prototype. Try to get to a minimal viable product as fast as possible. 
										<br /><br/>
										If you don’t have an idea for a business right now, take this time to learn skills. I think learning anything from tap dancing to Photoshop could help you in a future venture. 
										<br /><br/>
